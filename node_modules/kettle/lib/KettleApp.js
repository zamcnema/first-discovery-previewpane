/** A Kettle "app" is an "independently mountable application unit". An app aggregates together 
 * a set of "handlers" which are mounted within it to handle one or more request types
 * at certain URL paths. Kettle includes support for handlers of HTTP endpoints and
 * experimental support for WebSockets endpoints. One or more Kettle apps may be
 * aggregated together into a Kettle "servers" of type <code>kettle.server</code>. A Kettle
 * server corresponds directly to a node.js HTTP server (connect/express server) in terms
 * of being "a thing listening on a TCP port". Configuration supplied to the
 * options of all apps at their options path "handlers" is aggregated together to their enclosing
 * server.
